# UE OSAP Coursework Repository üìòüíª

Welcome to my repository for the **UE OSAP** course at IMT Atlantique, where I'm diving deep into the worlds of C programming, UNIX systems, and Windows .NET framework. This space serves as a digital notebook and showcase of what I've learned and created along the way.

## About UE OSAP üéì

UE OSAP (Operating Systems and Application Programming) is a course designed to give students a solid foundation in developing applications across different operating systems, with a focus on:

- **C Programming**: The bedrock of system software, offering a blend of performance and efficiency.
- **UNIX Systems**: Understanding the UNIX operating system, its architecture, and how to develop software in this environment.
- **Windows .NET**: Exploring the .NET framework for building applications on Windows platforms.

## Projects and Exercises üöÄ

This repository contains a mixture of homework, in-class exercises, and personal projects. Here's a breakdown of the content:

- `ProgSystem/`: Exercises about UNIX system general utilities and core system calls.
- `ProgReseau/`: Exercices about creating several client/server implementations, in TCP, UDP, and also a web server in C.
- `ProgSocket/`: Exercices about UNIX Sockets.
- `ProgPosix/`: An exercice to implement our own approximation of pi.
- `ProgWindows/`: Exercices on Windows on Processes, Threads and .NET remoting.

## Tools and Technologies üõ†Ô∏è

Throughout this course, I've worked with a range of tools and technologies, including:

- **OS**: MacOS Sonoma 14.3
- **Shell**: Fish 3.7.0
- **Terminal**: kitty
- **Terminal multiplexer**: tmux
- **Visualisation de processus**: htop
- **C LSP + Formatter**: C v15.0.0-clangd
- **IDE**: Nvim v0.9.5
- **Visual Studio 2022**: I developped on that IDE for the Windows Projects. (Windows, so previous tools are irrelevent)

## Learning Objectives üéØ

By the end of this course, I aim to:

- Gain proficiency in C programming and system-level development.
- Understand the principles of operating systems, especially UNIX/Linux.
- Develop basic applications using the Windows .NET framework.
- Improve my problem-solving and software development skills.
